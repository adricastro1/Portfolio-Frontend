    "bio": "Hi there! I'm a software developer who is passionate about working collaboratively and creatively to develop innovative solutions. With over 7 years of experience in customer service and management, I bring a unique perspective to my work. I love working in a team-oriented environment where I can showcase my skills in teamwork, client success, communication, and problem-solving. When I'm not coding, you can find me curled up with a good book, traveling to new and exciting destinations, or spending quality time with my two golden retrievers."
